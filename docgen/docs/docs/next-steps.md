After completing your first steps in smart contract development using OpenZeppelin, you may want to take a look at the guides which cover several common use cases and good practices: https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/guides/home

For example, the [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Smart Contracts in Ethereum](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05) will help you get an overview of the various tools needed for smart contract development, and you set up your environment.

[A Gentle Introduction to Ethereum Programming, Part 1](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/a-gentle-introduction-to-ethereum-programming-part-1-783cc7796094) provides very useful information on an introductory level, including many basic concepts from the Ethereum platform.

For a more in-depth dive, you may read the guide [Designing the architecture for your Ethereum application](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/designing-the-architecture-for-your-ethereum-application-9cec086f8317), which discusses how to better structure your application and its relationship to the real world.

You may also ask for help or follow OpenZeppelin's progress in the community [Slack](https://slack.openzeppelin.org), or read OpenZeppelin's full API on this website.
